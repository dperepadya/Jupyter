# Machine Learning Techniques - Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various machine learning techniques.
Each notebook covers a specific topic, including basic machine learning algorithms, advanced models, and performance evaluation methods.

## Introduction

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that learn from data and improve performance over time.
This repository aims to demonstrate core machine learning concepts with practical examples.
You will find a variety of techniques applied to datasets using Python's popular libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, and more.
